            <article>
                CLUB20, Under the aegis of Division of Student Welfare, LPU, has been built up to organise sports and
                social events, promoting physical and mental fitness and has successfully organised a number of events
                till date. Some of the past events of CLUB20 that have been a great success are: Nirvana 2.0,
                Swachhthon, Race for Grace, Fitness Talk, KTM Stunt Show, Corporate Cricket League and many more. The
                list goes on and so the success, with every event. We believe that no one can stop you unless you let
                them do so.
